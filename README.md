## USER INSTRUCTIONS

These are some copyright free/FREE web site templates   
for visitors of my GitHub pages to both *download/use*...;     
so, please, very kindly, help yourself.  

You may see written on the sites a notice such as:    

> Site design: paulramnoracoder@yahoo.com  

...optionally, you can either choose to leave that bit of code in there;      
so, that I can gain some credit for having originally *written/designed* it;      
or, alternatively, you may wish to *delete* that message completely;    
either way is perfectly fine with me. -Thanks!
